# Implementation of binary search algorithm!!
This is the implimentation of the Binary Search Algorithm with the Naive search algorithm. 
The idea is to compare the both algorithms using #Python to see which executes faster
We will prove that binary search is faster than naive search!

# Essence of binary search:
If you have a sorted list and you want to search this array for something,
You could go through each item in the list and ask, is this equal to what we're looking for?
But we can make this *faster* by leveraging the fact that our array is sorted!
# Binary search ~ O(log(n)), naive search ~ O(n)

In these two examples, l is a list in ascending order, and target is something that we're looking for
Return -1 if not found
